<h1>Self-Organising Text</h1>
<p>
  Inspired by self-organising cellular automata and the broader idea that <em>simple local rules</em> can yield <em>emergent global intelligence</em>.
  <br>
  <br>
  Here, I explore how self-organisation scales â€” starting from a physical basis in the Ising model.
  Then, we will jump into the text space and see if its possible for textual tokens, <em>looking only at their neighbours</em>, to organise into coherent text.
  <br>
  <br>
  I took a lot of inspiration from <a href="https://francesco215.github.io/Language_CA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    this</a> post by Francesco Sacco. If you find yourself wishing for a deeper understanding on emergence and the importance of the Ising model, I highly recommend you check it out.

<h2>Introduction: Self-organisation</h2>
<p>
  Self-organisation is a key principle in complex systems: local interactions can produce
  surprising global order. Examples range from flocking birds to financial markets.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cellular automata</strong> â†’ show how local update rules can produce global patterns.</li>
  <li><strong>Markets</strong> â†’ buyers/sellers act locally, prices emerge globally.</li>
  <li><strong>Neural systems</strong> â†’ synapses adapt locally, intelligence emerges globally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Ising Model</h2>
<p>
  The Ising model gives a clean mathematical framework for how local interactions
  can lead to collective alignment. In one dimension, the conventional result says
  no spontaneous magnetisation occurs â€” but with <em>interaction ranges above a critical threshold</em>,
  self-organisation <em>is</em> possible.

<p>Equation (rendered with LaTeX):</p>
<p>
  $$ H = -J \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{r=1}^R s_i s_{i+r} - h \sum_{i=1}^N s_i $$
</p>

<p>
  where \( s_i \in \{-1,+1\} \) are spins, \( J \) is the coupling constant, \( h \) an external field,
  and \( R \) the interaction range.

<h2>Derivation & Critical Range</h2>
<p>
  A short derivation (details to come). The key insight is that increasing the interaction
  range \( R \) above a critical threshold allows stable ordering in 1D.

<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>
  Self-organisation is a general principle â€” whether in physics, markets, or language models.
  Local rules, scaled properly, can produce unexpected intelligence.
